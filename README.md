# dnl_tools
 - Tools I made for personal usage and learning purposes
 - Everything I am doing or I will do is in my To-do list

## Tools
* break_reminder.sh **(bash)**: show a timer on the screen 
* create_pyfile.py **(python2.7)**: create python files with sections
* gmailapi **(python2.7)**: package to send and schedule mails
* sendfoodlist.py **(python2.7)**: schedule a mail with the food list
* timer.py **(python2.7)**: timer for general purposes
* todo_list.py **(python2.7)**: interface to manage my to-do list, I am too lazy to use emacs :smiley:

## Supports 
* exec_break.sh **(bash)**: execute the break reminder using cron
* newpyfile **(bash)**: make executable the file created by create_pyfile.py

## Fun
* shell_stats.py **(python2.7)**: stats of the type of commands executed in terminal
